I am a research staff at [PSILab](https://www.psilab.uliege.be) within the [STAR](https://www.star.uliege.be) institute at the University of Liège, specializing in astronomical instrumentation, adaptive optics (AO), and high-contrast imaging (HCI) for the direct detection and characterization of exoplanets.

Over the past 15 years, I have contributed to major projects, including
- ELT/METIS: Leading the development of non-common path aberration control strategies and serving as the local project manager for ULiège. My work spans all aspects of METIS' high-contrast imaging modes, from component development and end-to-end HCI simulations, to upcoming performance testing.
- VLT/ERIS: Technical lead for the focal plane coronagraphs (vortex phase masks in L- and M-bands) and supporting scientific exploitation.
- SALTO: responsible for the development of the AO instrument, a robust laser-guided AO demonstrator for astronomy, space debris tracking, and optical telecommunications.
- LBT/ARGOS: Development and on-sky commissioning of the laser-guided ground-layer AO system, including wavefront sensor design and integration.

My research combines theoretical modeling, experimental validation, and on-sky deployment, with a strong emphasis on focal plane wavefront sensing, deep learning, and reinforcement learning techniques. I also have a background in extragalactic astronomy, studying the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies using near-infrared integral field spectroscopy.

I hold a PhD in Astronomy from the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (2014). Since 2024, I have been appointed as a permanent researcher at ULiège, where I focus on high-contrast imaging and contribute to the development of next-generation instruments like ELT/METIS.

<!-- My main focus is currently ground-based instrumentation for high contrast and high angular resolution in astronomy. In the past 10+ years, I have contributed to the development of laser assisted adaptive optics systems (SALTO, ARGOS) and stellar coronagraphs (VODCA, METIS/ELT, ERIS/VLT). In particular, I am now actively involved in the development of the high contrast imaging mode of METIS/ELT.

One of my current research interest is to tackle one of the big hurdles of direct imaging : quasi-static aberrations preventing us to reach the fundamental limit for ground-based high contrast imaging. More specifically, I currently focus on the development of focal plane wavefront sensing solutions using deep learning techniques.
Besides instrumentation, I have had various interests in astronomy, ranging from the direct detection and characterization of exoplanets, but also such as nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and their interplay with galactic evolution, and exotic gravitational lenses. -->
