I am an astronomer, research assistant, engineer and project manager at the University of Liège.

My main focus is currently ground-based instrumentation for high contrast and high angular resolution in astronomy. In the past 10+ years, I have contributed to the development of laser assisted adaptive optics systems (SALTO, ARGOS) and stellar coronagraphs (VODCA, METIS/ELT, ERIS/VLT). In particular, I am now actively involved in the development of the high contrast imaging mode of METIS/ELT.

One of my current research interest is to tackle one of the big hurdles of direct imaging : quasi-static aberrations preventing us to reach the fundamental limit for ground-based high contrast imaging. More specifically, I currently focus on the development of focal plane wavefront sensing solutions using deep learning techniques.
Besides instrumentation, I have had various interests in astronomy, ranging from the direct detection and characterization of exoplanets, but also such as nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and their interplay with galactic evolution, and exotic gravitational lenses.
